                    <p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.
                         It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.
                         The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[10] PHP was originally an 
                         abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP:
                          Hypertext Preprocessor.

                        PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as 
                        a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, 
                        the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code which may be any type of data,
                         such as generated HTML or binary image data  would form the whole or part of an 
                         HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and 
                         web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation
                          of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the 
                          web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.
                           PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
                        
                        The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free 
                        software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be 
                        deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.
                        
                        The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014,
                         with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations
                          aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.
                        
                        W3Techs reports that, as of January 2023, "PHP is used by 77.8% of all the websites whose 
                        server-side programming language we know." It also reports that only 8% of PHP users use
                         the currently supported 8.x versions. Most use unsupported PHP 7, more specifically 7.4,
                         and even PHP 5 has 23% of the use, also not supported with security updates, known to 
                         have serious security vulnerabilities.
